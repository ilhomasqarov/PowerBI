2.

One-to-many (1:*): Most common

Many-to-many (:)

3.
Go to Model view, drag a column (e.g., CustomerID) from one table to the matching column in another.

4.
A star schema is a data model with a central fact table connected to multiple dimension tables.

5.
The Sales table—it holds transactional data like orders, quantities, and prices.

6.
Create a relationship from Sales.CustomerID to Customers.CustomerID, with one-to-many direction.

7.
Because it links to the Products table—ProductID in Sales references ProductID in Products (foreign key).

8.
Change one of the ProductID columns so both have the same data type (e.g., text or whole number).

9.
Star schemas reduce complexity, minimize joins, and improve performance by simplifying relationships.

11.
Break circular relationships by:

Removing unnecessary relationships

Using DAX functions like USERELATIONSHIP instead of physical relationships


13.
Use a bridge table (e.g., CustomerProduct interactions) to break the many-to-many link into two one-to-many relationships.

14.
Only when filters from both sides are truly needed—for example, filter propagation in complex slicers or reporting scenarios.
