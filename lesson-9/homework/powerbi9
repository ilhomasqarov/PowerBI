1.
Row context means DAX processes one row at a time, usually in calculated columns.
Example: In a calculated column, TotalPrice = Sales[Quantity] * Sales[UnitPrice] calculates for each row individually.

2.

Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales])


3.

Customer Name = RELATED(Customers[Name])


(This pulls the customerâ€™s name into the Sales table based on a relationship.)

4.

CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Quantity]), Sales[Category] = "Electronics")


Returns the total quantity sold where Category is Electronics, applying a filter.

5.

VAR defines variables to store intermediate values or tables.

RETURN outputs the final result using those variables.

6.
Calculated column example:

TotalPrice = Sales[Quantity] * Sales[UnitPrice]


7.
Measure for Electronics Sales:

Electronics Sales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Sales]), Sales[Category] = "Electronics")


8.
Measure ignoring category filters:

Total Sales All Categories = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Sales]), ALL(Sales[Category]))


9.
If RELATED(Customers[Region]) returns blanks, likely the relationship between Sales and Customers tables is missing or inactive.
