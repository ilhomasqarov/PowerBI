1. DAX stands for Data Analysis Expressions — it’s the formula language used in Power BI.

2. To sum the Sales column:

Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales])


3. A calculated column adds data row by row in your table and is stored physically. A measure calculates results on the fly, depending on filters and context, so it’s more dynamic.

4. Calculate Profit Margin safely using DIVIDE:

Profit Margin = DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Profit]), SUM(Sales[Sales]))


5. COUNTROWS() simply counts how many rows are in a table or filtered subset.

6. Total Profit measure subtracting total cost from total sales:

Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Sales]) - SUM(Sales[Cost])


7. To find average sales per product:

Average Sales per Product = AVERAGE(Sales[Sales])


8. Tag products as “High Profit” if profit is over 1000:

Profit Tag = IF(SUM(Sales[Profit]) > 1000, "High Profit", "Low Profit")


9. A circular dependency error happens when a calculated column ends up referring to itself directly or indirectly, causing a loop Power BI can’t resolve.

10.

Row context means Power BI is looking at one row at a time (used in calculated columns).

Filter context means calculations respect filters applied in reports (used in measures).

11. Calculate Year-To-Date (YTD) sales:

YTD Sales = TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales[Sales]), Sales[Date])


12. Dynamic measure switching between Sales, Profit, and Margin:

Selected Measure = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    SELECTEDVALUE(MeasureSelector[Measure]) = "Sales", SUM(Sales[Sales]),
    SELECTEDVALUE(MeasureSelector[Measure]) = "Profit", SUM(Sales[Profit]),
    SELECTEDVALUE(MeasureSelector[Measure]) = "Margin", DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Profit]), SUM(Sales[Sales]))
)
